1,RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,4,5,4,4,"Recommendations are accurate and suitable for the Indo-Gangetic plains, showing local context and low maintenance priorities, but the lack of explicit sunlight data for Jasmine slightly reduces factual completeness and potential for more culturally nuanced plant choices."
1,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,4,2,2,3,"The plant list is factually correct for general partial sun conditions, but many selections are temperate species unlikely to thrive or are difficult to maintain long-term in the Indo-Gangetic Plains' heat and humidity; little local adaptation or cultural relevance is demonstrated."
1,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,4,5,4,4,"The botanical information is correct and scientific names are accurate; both Catharanthus roseus and Jasminum officinale are suited for the Indo-Gangetic plain and partial sun, with some minor lack of precision regarding Jasminum’s sunlight tolerance, but cultural and climate context is largely appropriate and actionable."
1,No-RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,3,2,2,2,"While the list accurately describes part-shade flowering plants for general conditions, most suggested species (e.g., Impatiens, Fuchsia, Camellia, Lobelia, Astilbe, Hellebores) are either poorly adapted, not native, or rarely cultivated in the hot-humid subtropical conditions and soils of the Indo-Gangetic Plain; the response lacks climate- and context-specific recommendations and omits regionally appropriate ornamentals."
1,RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,4,5,3,4,"The plant recommendations are accurate and region-suitable, but the answer lacks details on local cultural uses or vernacular names (e.g., Sadabahar for periwinkle, Mogra for jasmine) and doesn't highlight traditional significance, though practical planting advice is useful."
1,No-RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,4,2,1,2,"The suggestions are factually accurate for partial-shade flora, but most listed plants (e.g., impatiens, hydrangea, fuchsia, camellia) are non-native exotics rarely used in the Indo-Gangetic plains, lacking any reference to indigenous, Ayurvedic, or culturally relevant species or naming, thus offering little cultural depth or ecological appropriateness for the region."
1,RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,5,5,5,"The response accurately recommends drought-tolerant, widely naturalized, and culturally relevant species (Tiny Periwinkle, Jasmine) ideal for morning light, with a strong note on resource conservation and practical advice for the Indo-Gangetic context."
1,No-RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,4,2,2,3,"While the plant list is generally correct for partial sun conditions, most species listed are non-native and/or water-intensive in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, with little consideration for drought tolerance, local ecology, or cultural planting traditions."
1,RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,5,4,5,"The response accurately recommends common, locally appropriate flowering plants for a courtyard with morning sun, highlights their light and care needs in plain language, and gives a useful beginner tip, but could mention more culturally-significant options."
1,No-RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,4,3,2,3,"The advice is accurate for partial sun, but most listed plants are common in temperate rather than Indo-Gangetic climates; more locally adapted or commonly grown species would be more culturally and ecologically suitable."

2,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,3,2,1,2,"Response recommends North American shrubs rather than those native or appropriate to the Indo-Gangetic Plains, resulting in poor ecological and cultural fit despite general landscape safety advice."
2,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,5,5,4,4,"The response accurately addresses the lack of explicit evidence in the corpus, correctly includes native species with proper Latin names, and offers pragmatic, regionally appropriate management strategies, though cultural context could be deeper."
2,No-RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,2,1,1,1,"The response neglects the Indo-Gangetic Plain context, recommends North American genera (Ceanothus, Mahonia, Ribes, Kalmia, Viburnum) unsuitable for this region, uses common names without Latin binomials, and lacks locally relevant information regarding native flora, soil, and climate; overall, this is misleading for the user's needs."
2,RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,5,5,3,4,"The response is factually correct in acknowledging the lack of concrete evidence about wildlife attraction for the specific shrubs, ecologically appropriate to the Indo-Gangetic Plains, but only somewhat culturally relevant due to limited mention of indigenous practices or local perceptions; overall, advice is pragmatic and helpful."
2,No-RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,3,2,1,2,"The response is factually solid for North America but ignores the Indo-Gangetic Plains, recommending irrelevant, often non-native plants; no Indian cultural or ethnobotanical context is given, leading to poor regional suitability and cultural relevance."
2,RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,5,4,4,"The response accurately reports corpus limits, lists appropriate native shrubs, and gives locally relevant maintenance advice, but doesn't fully address cultural landscape practices or name alternatives that are less likely to harbor snakes or rodents."
2,No-RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,3,2,1,2,"The response lists North American shrubs rather than Indo-Gangetic Plains natives, so the ecological and cultural relevance is quite poor; while the general advice is sound, species suggestions are neither suitable nor sustainable for the region in question."
2,RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,4,5,4,4,"The answer is honest about the lack of specific data, recommends native plants suitable for the Indo-Gangetic Plains, and gives sensible maintenance tips but could be more culturally tailored with direct local examples or practices."
2,No-RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,3,2,2,2,"The advice is accurate in general but is only partially relevant and suitable for the Indo-Gangetic Plains—the listed plants are North American natives, not local to India, and there’s little local context or directly actionable options for Indo-Gangetic homeowners."
3,RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,4,4,5,"Plant selections are well-suited for the Indo-Gangetic Plains' rooftop conditions and information is reliable, but ginger's higher water needs could pose a maintenance issue; overall, it addresses climate, aesthetics, and practical tips with cultural awareness."
3,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,4,4,3,4,"Recommendations are generally correct and appropriate for hot rooftops but lack clear distinction between Indo-Gangetic endemic and exotic species; many listed plants are suitable but some (e.g., blue fescue, feather reed grass) are not native and may not align with regional or embassy landscape protocols."
3,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,5,5,5,5,"Detailed and botanically accurate advice with correct Latin names, precise climate and soil requirements for each species, and practical, region-specific rooftop gardening tips demonstrating awareness of local ecological and cultural context."
3,No-RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,4,3,2,3,"The list includes many heat-tolerant plants, but lacks scientific (Latin) names, omits discussion of local Indo-Gangetic climate/soil details, and includes species more suitable for temperate rather than subtropical climates (e.g., blue fescue, feather reed grass); it is moderately helpful but not region-specific or scientifically rigorous."
3,RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,5,5,4,5,"The plant selections are regionally appropriate and described accurately, with useful cultivation details; some plants (e.g., Vitex negundo) have rich cultural/medicinal links in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, although mentioning Hindi/local names and deeper traditional uses would show greater cultural insight."
3,No-RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,4,4,2,3,"The suggestions are generally accurate and suitable for hot rooftop conditions, but the plant list is generic, with limited focus on species endemic or traditionally important to the Indo-Gangetic Plains or their Ayurvedic/folk relevance."
3,RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,4,4,4,"Accurate plant descriptions and climate suitability; mostly selects regionally tolerant, relatively low-water plants, although ginger's higher water needs and a non-native mention reduce suitability; advice is locally relevant and practical."
3,No-RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,4,2,3,3,"The response suggests many globally heat-tolerant plants, but several (lavender, sedum, echeveria, blue fescue, agave) are non-native and may not be sustainable or ecologically suitable for the Indo-Gangetic Plains, showing limited emphasis on native species and water conservation specific to regional context."
3,RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,5,5,5,"The advice is specific, accurate for the Indo-Gangetic plains, highlights heat-tolerant local plants, and offers simple, practical rooftop gardening tips."
3,No-RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,5,4,5,"The list is accurate and practical for the Indo-Gangetic Plains' hot rooftop conditions, names commonly grown plants, and the advice is clear and actionable, though a few more region-specific notes could improve cultural relevance."
4,RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,5,4,5,"The response accurately describes species suited to the Indo-Gangetic Plain, recommends them appropriately for dust control, and provides maintenance guidance, but gives only moderate attention to local cultural values."
4,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,4,4,3,4,"The suggestions are generally effective and regionally plausible, but some species (like Oleander and Ivy) are not ideal due to toxicity or invasiveness, and there is limited focus on native/culturally significant species for the Indo-Gangetic Plains."
4,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,5,5,4,5,"The response provides accurate botanical names, specific climate/soil details, and sound horticultural reasoning; Vitex negundo is widely used in shelterbelts and Catharanthus roseus is ecologically appropriate for disturbed areas, but there could be slightly deeper local cultural context included (e.g., traditional uses or regional preferences)."
4,No-RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,4,3,3,4,"Most suggestions are botanically accurate and plausible for dust reduction, but some species (Privet, Oleander, Jacaranda, Ivy, Buffalo grass) can be invasive or poorly suited to the Indo-Gangetic Plain; regional specificity and more focus on endemic, culturally familiar species would increase suitability and relevance."
4,RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,5,5,4,5,"Vitex negundo and Catharanthus roseus are both well-suited to the Indo-Gangetic Plains; Vitex negundo especially is locally used for dust and wind barriers, though inclusion of more local names (e.g., 'Nirgundi' for Vitex) and deeper discussion of their traditional significance (e.g., Ayurveda uses) would further enhance cultural context."
4,No-RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,4,4,3,4,"Most plant suggestions are suitable and accurate for dust reduction in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, but some (like Jacaranda, Silver oak, ivy, and certain grasses) are either non-native, less commonly used, or could become invasive; the response provides good general advice, but misses deeper reference to traditional or culturally significant species and omits local names or Ayurvedic relevance."
4,RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,5,4,5,"Both Vitex negundo and Catharanthus roseus are ecologically suitable, drought-tolerant species native or naturalized in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, offering effective dust control and low resource needs; suggestions are regionally appropriate, but slightly more reference to local planting traditions would improve cultural relevance."
4,No-RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,4,2,3,3,"While the answer contains many accurate dust-mitigating strategies, several recommended species (like Oleander, Privet, Jacaranda, Silver oak, and Ivy) are non-native, potentially invasive, or require more water/fertilizer, and the list misses an emphasis on native drought-resistant and low-maintenance plants typical for the Indo-Gangetic Plains; local cultural plant preferences are referenced only cursorily."
4,RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,5,4,5,"The response recommends regionally appropriate plants (Vitex negundo, Catharanthus roseus) with clear, practical advice and sound rationale, though a few more culturally linked examples would make it perfect."
4,No-RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,4,4,5,"The plant suggestions are mostly accurate and suitable for the Indo-Gangetic Plains, with clear, practical advice, but a few species (e.g., Oleander, Privet, Ivy) could be problematic or less typical for the local context, while most recommendations show thoughtful consideration of local gardening needs."
5,RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,4,4,5,"The suggestions are factually accurate and regionally appropriate, offer practical advice, and reference culturally relevant species, but could be improved with mentions of ornamental value explicitly and more detail about maintenance impacts."
5,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,3,2,2,2,"While the list contains tough plants for poor soils, most selections (e.g., Black-eyed Susan, Coneflower, Russian Sage, Buffalograss, Bur Oak, etc.) are native to North America and poorly suited, both ecologically and culturally, to the Indo-Gangetic Plains; no account is taken of local context, traditional plants, or climate, reducing overall appropriateness and usefulness."
5,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,4,4,4,4,"The response is scientifically credible, gives correct Latin names, and the listed species (Catharanthus roseus and Acacia concinna) are regionally appropriate and genuinely hardy; however, C. roseus generally prefers better drainage than extremely compacted soils, and some more region-specific character (e.g., hardy local grasses or millets) could be mentioned for full marks."
5,No-RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,3,2,2,2,"Most plant suggestions are native to North America and poorly adapted to the Indo-Gangetic Plain's climate, soils, and cultural preferences; several are unsuited or even potentially invasive, and there is no reference to truly regionally appropriate or culturally significant species."
5,RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,4,4,4,4,"Recommendations are factually sound; both Catharanthus roseus and Acacia concinna tolerate poor soils and have known regional use, but deeper reference to Indo-Gangetic folk names, Ayurveda, and rituals would enhance cultural and ethnobotanical context."
5,No-RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,3,2,1,2,"The listed plants are mostly North American species and not adapted or traditionally grown in the Indo-Gangetic Plains; the response lacks mention of local species, Indian names, and culturally significant or traditionally resilient plants, resulting in low regional and cultural relevance despite general advice on soil improvement."
5,RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,4,5,5,"Recommendations are factually correct, culturally appropriate for the Indo-Gangetic Plains, and emphasize low water/fertilizer use; however, Catharanthus roseus is non-native and could be replaced with a strictly native alternative for maximal ecological suitability."
5,No-RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,4,2,2,3,"While the plant list is accurate for general hard soils, most suggested species are non-native to the Indo-Gangetic Plains and may not thrive with local climate, pests, or cultural practices; native or regionally adapted species should be prioritized for sustainability and water conservation."
5,RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,5,5,5,"The response recommends regionally appropriate, hardy plants well-suited for tough soils, addresses specific local conditions, avoids unsuitable types, and gives actionable, simple advice—all in a clear, jargon-free way."
5,No-RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,4,3,2,3,"The plant list is mostly accurate for tough soils, but most examples are North American natives rather than plants proven for the Indo-Gangetic Plains, making recommendations less locally useful and potentially inappropriate for the region's climate and cultural preferences."
6,RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,5,5,5,"The response accurately identifies Jasmine and Musk Mallow as fragrant evening plants well-suited to the Indo-Gangetic Plains, provides relevant horticultural and cultural information, cites corpus limitations, and offers practical user-centric advice."
6,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,4,5,5,"The response lists accurate and locally relevant plants, prioritizes species suited to the Indo-Gangetic Plains (e.g., jasmine, parijat, tuberose), and provides selection advice, though a few (Gardenia, Brugmansia, Alyssum) can be less suitable or more maintenance-heavy in hot climates."
6,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,5,5,4,5,"The response gives correct Latin names, accurate fragrance timing, proper soil/climate needs for the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and mentions traditional/cultural uses; however, cultural context could be a bit deeper."
6,No-RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,4,4,5,4,"The response accurately identifies many fragrant evening plants, most with correct Latin names and clear Indian context, but includes some (e.g., Epiphyllum oxypetalum, Lobularia maritima) of questionable suitability for most Indo-Gangetic conditions without further caveats about their adaptability."
6,RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,5,5,4,5,"The response accurately identifies Jasmine and Musk Mallow as evening fragrant plants, both well-adapted to the Indo-Gangetic Plains with traditional uses and local naming; it briefly references local experience, though deeper folklore or cultural rituals could further enrich cultural context."
6,No-RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,5,4,4,5,"The response lists plants largely suited to the Indo-Gangetic Plains, uses correct local names (e.g., Raat ki Rani, Rajnigandha, Parijat), and connects usages to garden placement, but could deepen cultural context by relating more to their use in rituals or folklore."
6,RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,5,5,5,"Jasmine and Musk Mallow are both regionally suitable, require moderate inputs, are culturally significant, and the information is accurate and locally contextualized for the Indo-Gangetic Plains."
6,No-RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,3,5,4,"The response is factually correct and highlights several culturally significant and locally relevant plants (like Raat ki Rani, Rajnigandha, Parijat), but includes exotic or water-demanding species (e.g., Brugmansia, Gardenia, Sweet Alyssum, Epiphyllum) that may require additional water, care, or could be invasive, slightly lowering ecological suitability and overall helpfulness for sustainability."
6,RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,5,5,5,"The response accurately describes two plants well-known and suitable for the region, highlights their fragrance specifically in the evening, provides practical local tips, and is clear for average gardeners."
6,No-RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,5,5,5,5,"The response accurately lists well-known evening-fragrant plants that thrive in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, uses easy language, references local plant names, and offers practical, culturally relevant advice."
7,RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,4,4,5,"The response accurately lists regionally appropriate, shallow-rooted plants and gives sound structural guidance, with minor room to recommend more local ornamentals or caution about Catharanthus roseus invasiveness in some settings."
7,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,4,2,2,3,"The recommendations offer correct general guidance about non-invasive roots and spacing, but most plant suggestions are non-native, regionally inappropriate, and not tailored for the Indo-Gangetic Plains’ climate or cultural context."
7,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,5,5,5,5,"The response provides appropriate species with correct Latin names, details their growth habits to minimize risk to tank structures, notes specific soil and climate preferences relevant to the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and offers culturally and ecologically tailored advice with a technically accurate warning section; no factual errors are present."
7,No-RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,3,2,1,2,"Most suggested species are not native or widely cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, some are invasive elsewhere or require conditions uncommon to the area; there is no reference to local climate, soil, or cultural plant use, and Australian natives are irrelevant here."
7,RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,5,5,4,5,"Suggestions are botanically accurate, ecologically adapted to the Indo-Gangetic region, and carefully avoid structural risk, though more explicit reference to local naming or traditional uses in the Indo-Gangetic context would enhance the cultural insight."
7,No-RAG,Evaluator_3_Cultural_Historian,3,2,1,2,"The response lists mostly non-native, ornamental plants (many Australian/Western species) unsuited to the Indo-Gangetic Plains; it ignores regional plant traditions, local drought/flood cycles, Ayurveda, and common Indian names or uses."
7,RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,5,4,4,5,"The response suggests plants with non-invasive roots suitable for the Indo-Gangetic Plains, prioritizes water conservation, and gives practical, context-aware advice, though Azolla and Marsilea may need more ecological caution due to habitat specificity."
7,No-RAG,Evaluator_4_Sustainability_Officer,4,3,3,3,"Advice on root systems and plant-tank safety is solid, but most specific plant suggestions are not native or suited to Indo-Gangetic Plains and may require higher water/fertilizer; the response references Australian natives, reducing local ecological and cultural relevance."

7,No-RAG,Evaluator_5_General_Resident,4,3,2,3,The advice on root systems and general plant selection is accurate and safe for water tanks but most recommended plants are not common or native to the Indo-Gangetic Plains; response lacks region-specific plant examples and local cultural context.
8,RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,4,4,4,"The response accurately describes plant requirements and uses, focuses on regionally appropriate species, and gives actionable design advice, but periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus/Vinca) can be mildly invasive and is toxic, so it’s less ideal for kitchen herb gardens."
8,No-RAG,Evaluator_1_Landscape_Architect,5,4,4,5,"All herbs listed are factual, commonly grown in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, accurate in their medicinal uses, generally non-invasive, but could mention holy basil (Tulsi) for higher cultural relevance; the advice is practical and low maintenance."
8,RAG,Evaluator_2_Local_Botanist,4,4,5,5,"The response demonstrates strong botanical accuracy (minor overstatement with periwinkle as a kitchen herb), wisely matches plants to Indo-Gangetic Plain conditions, fully contextualizes in local culture and use, and provides tailored, actionable advice for users in the region."
