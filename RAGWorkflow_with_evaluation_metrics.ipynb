    "## Core Instructions and Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Prioritize Context:** You MUST base all plant facts, recommendations, and data **directly** on the provided `Plant Corpus` context. Do not use your general knowledge if it conflicts with the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Synthesize, Don't Just Repeat:** When answering, intelligently synthesize information from the context's fields. For example, to answer \"what plant should I grow,\" you MUST combine `Climate Requirements`, `Soil Type`, and `Water Needs` to explain *why* a plant is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Handle Missing Information (Critical):** If the user asks about a plant, region, or topic that is **not** in the provided context, you MUST clearly state that the information is not available in your specialized corpus. However, you can use your general knowledge to invent an answer for a plant not in list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Use Your Persona:** After you have provided the core facts *from the corpus*, you may add a brief, practical tip based on your persona (e.g., \"In my experience on the plains, this plant also helps with soil erosion,\" or \"Be sure to protect it from...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Corpus Structure (For Your Reference):**\n",
    "    `Plant ID`, `Common Name`, `Scientific Name`, `Local Name (If Applicable)`, `Region`, `Climate Requirements`, `Soil Type`, `Sun Light Needs`, `Water Needs`, `Growth Rate`, `Ecological Role`, `Traditional Uses`\n",

      "\n",
      "### Why Neem is Suitable:\n",
      "- **Climate Requirements:** Neem thrives in tropical to subtropical climates, exactly like those found across the Indo-Gangetic Plain.\n",
      "- **Soil Type:** It prefers well-drained sandy to loamy soils but is also tolerant of poor and dry soils, matching your description.\n",
      "- **Water Needs:** Neem is highly drought-resistant and requires low water, making it ideal for areas where water is scarce.\n",
      "- **Growth:** It has a moderate to fast growth rate and can reach up to 15 meters tall, providing shade and wind protection.\n",
      "- **Ecological Role:** Aside from its hardiness, Neem improves soil fertility and acts as a natural pest repellent, supporting agriculture and local biodiversity.\n",
      "- **Traditional Value:** All parts of the Neem are useful in traditional medicine and rituals, giving it additional value for your community.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Practical Tip:**  \n",
      "In my experience on the Indo-Gangetic plains, Neem trees also help control local pests naturally and offer valuable shade, which can be a real boon during hot summers. Just make sure to give young saplings some protection from grazing animals until they're well-established.\n"

      "In the Indo-Gangetic Plain, if your soil has poor nutrients and limited water availability, **millets** are among the best choices. Here’s why and what you can consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Millets?\n",
      "- **Drought tolerant:** Millets require much less water than rice or wheat.\n",
      "- **Low soil fertility:** They grow well in poor soils and do not demand heavy fertilization.\n",
      "- **Short growing period:** Many millets mature faster than other grains.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Crop: **Pearl Millet (Bajra)**\n",
      "- Very drought-hardy.\n",
      "- Deep root system helps it find water.\n",
      "- A staple in semi-arid regions of northern and western India.\n",
      "- Rich in nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other Options:\n",
      "1. **Sorghum (Jowar)**: Tolerates drought and poor soils well.\n",
      "2. **Finger Millet (Ragi)**: Does well on less fertile land and with low rainfall.\n",
      "3. **Pigeon Pea (Tur/Arhar Dal)**: A pulse crop that improves soil fertility (fixes nitrogen) and uses little water.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Good Practices:\n",
      "- **Add organic matter** if possible (compost, manure) to improve soil structure.\n",
      "- Use **mulching** to conserve soil moisture.\n",
      "- **Intercrop** millets with legumes to enhance soil fertility naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bottom line:**  \n",
      "For poor, dry soils in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, millets like pearl millet (bajra) or sorghum (jowar) are your best bet, possibly intercropped with pulses like pigeon pea for better soil and food security.\n"
