      "For the Indo-Gangetic Plain with **poor (low-nutrient) soil** and **limited water availability**, **Neem (Azadirachta indica)** is highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Neem?\n",
      "- **Climate Adaptation:** Neem thrives in tropical to subtropical climates, which matches the Indo-Gangetic plain.\n",
      "- **Drought Tolerance:** It is *highly drought-resistant* and does well with *low water availability*.\n",
      "- **Soil Requirements:** Prefers *well-drained sandy to loamy soils* but *tolerates poor and dry soils* exceptionally well.\n",
      "- **Sunlight:** Requires *full sunlight*, which is abundant in most parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain.\n",
      "- **Growth & Benefits:** Grows *moderately fast*, can provide *shade and wind protection*, and helps *improve soil fertility* over time.\n",
      "- **Ecological Role:** Supports biodiversity and naturally repels pests, making it great both for shade and as a companion plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bonus:\n",
      "Neem has valuable **traditional uses** (medicinal, ritual, and as a natural pesticide), making it a useful addition for practical and cultural reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "- **Recommended plant:** Neem (Azadirachta indica)\n",
      "- **Why:** Tolerates poor soils, needs little water, improves local ecology, and brings multiple benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need options suited to different purposes (ornamental, shade, or ecosystem restoration), let me know!\n"

      "\n",
      "#### **1. Pearl Millet (Bajra; Pennisetum glaucum)**\n",
      "- **Why:** Very drought-tolerant, grows well in poor, sandy soils.\n",
      "- **Usage:** Main food crop, fodder, good for improving soil organic matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Sorghum (Jowar; Sorghum bicolor)**\n",
      "- **Why:** Handles drought very well, requires little fertilizer.\n",
      "- **Usage:** Good for grain, fodder, and soil conservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Cluster Bean (Guar; Cyamopsis tetragonoloba)**\n",
      "- **Why:** Leguminous, improves soil fertility, very tolerant to drought.\n",
      "- **Usage:** Vegetable, source of guar gum, green manure.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **4. Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia)**\n",
      "- **Why:** Grows well on marginal and dry soils, fixes nitrogen.\n",
      "- **Usage:** Pulses, green manure, forage.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **5. Amaranth (Amaranthus spp.)**\n",
      "- **Why:** Grows in poor soils, requires minimal irrigation.\n",
      "- **Usage:** Leaves and seeds are edible and nutritious.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **6. Leguminous cover crops (e.g., Sesbania, Cowpea)**\n",
      "- **Why:** Will fix nitrogen, improve poor soils, need relatively little water.\n",
      "- **Usage:** Green manure, fodder, improves subsequent crop yields.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Other Tips:**\n",
      "- **Mulching:** Helps retain soil moisture and improves soil over time.\n",
      "- **Compost/FYM:** If possible, incorporate organic matter to improve soil structure and fertility.\n",
      "- **Water harvesting:** Use rainwater collection or micro-irrigation to maximize available water.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need edible plants, **Pearl Millet, Sorghum, and Cluster Bean** are among the best choices. If improving soil is your target, **leguminous cover crops** like cowpea and moth bean are excellent. All these options should thrive with minimal water and low-fertility soils, especially when managed with good practices.\n"
